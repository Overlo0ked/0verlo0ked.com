        <p>
            I'm <strong>Alwin Joshy</strong>, a cybersecurity enthusiast and ethical hacker driven by a deep passion for breaking, building, and securing systems. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Applications, I’ve carved my own learning path focused on hands-on experience, research, and continuous improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            From participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to crafting custom honeypots and diving deep into binary exploitation, I thrive on uncovering security flaws and understanding how things work under the hood. I’m especially drawn to offensive security, reverse engineering, and web exploitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I actively share my journey through technical writeups, contribute to the hacking community, and am constantly evolving through self-study and practical challenges. For me, hacking is not just a skill—it's a mindset of curiosity, persistence, and creativity.
